### Welcome to Blinkly (WIP)

All of the hard-work that makes this possible is done by the creators of Blockly, and BlocklyDuino (among other C/C++) ports of Block-based programming. Blinkly is simply a tool that allows Blinks owners to create their own games using a Block-based programming language, and this is achieved by creating a generator that can reproduce the limited language of Blinks. I look forward to making the UI/UX refined to match the usability and aesthetics of Blinks as well ðŸ˜˜.

> See [BlocklyDuino](https://github.com/BlocklyDuino/BlocklyDuino)

Blinkly is based on [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/), the web-based, graphical programming editor. Provide static type language blocks and code generators for Blinks programming.

### Features

* Programming Blinks with visually drag and drop code blocks
* Generate fully compatible Blinks source code
* Load example games to see how Blinkly can be used to create the existing games on Blinks (sometimes simplified versions for clarity)

### Demo

Blinkly is a web tool. You can give it a try at
[Web](http://jbobrow.github.io/Blinkly/blockly/apps/blocklyduino/) to see the working Blinkly.

You can link directly to example games
* [WHAM!](http://blocklyduino.github.io/BlocklyDuino/blockly/apps/blocklyduino/index.html?url=examples/wham.xml)
* [Berry](http://blocklyduino.github.io/BlocklyDuino/blockly/apps/blocklyduino/index.html?url=examples/berry.xml)
* [Alchematch](http://blocklyduino.github.io/BlocklyDuino/blockly/apps/blocklyduino/index.html?url=examples/alchematch.xml)

Or watch the [video demos]() __Coming Soon__

### Run locally on your web browser
If you want to install it locally. Get code from github and open `blockly/apps/blocklyduino/index.html` in your browser. 

The preffered way is to put the `BlocklyDuino/web` folder into a web server and open the url like `localhost/public/blockly/apps/blocklyduino/index.html` for use.

### Integrated Arduino upload
To avoid the tedious step of manually pasting code to the Arduino IDE, you can run a mini webserver that uses
the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to upload the code to a connected Arduino board on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux systems.
Invoke this command from the BlocklyDuino root folder:
```
python arduino_web_server.py 
```

You can optionally specify the port with `--port=COM3` (or `--port=/dev/tty.foo` on Linux and Mac); 
if you don't, it will try and guess which port to use.

When the webserver is running, you can access BlocklyDuino itself on [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/).

### Usage
1. Open browser to BlocklyDuino, drag and drop blocks to make an Arduino program
2. Select the `Arduino` tab and copy all of the source code into an existing or new project in the Arduino IDE
3. Press the `Upload` button in the Arduino IDE to burn the code into a connected Arduino board

OR (if running `arduino_web_server.py`):
1. Open browser to BlocklyDuino, drag and drop blocks to make an Arduino program.
2. Select the `Arduino` tab and press the `Upload` button. (press the `Reset` button to upload an empty program)

In GNU/Linux OS (i.e. Ubuntu 18.04x64) 
1. Open one terminal, go the BlocklyDuino path and run:   
python arduino_web_server.py --port=/dev/ttyUSB0   
2. Open a new terminal and run:   
firefox http://127.0.0.1:8080/ 
3. Once BlocklyDuino is open in the browser, drag and drop blocks to make an Arduino program or 
load an example by clicking on `LoadXML` (e.g. /blocky/apps/blockyduino/examples/blink.xml or other in the same path)
4. Press `Upload` and wait until you see `Program uploaded ok` and press OK!
5. Close terminals with `Ctrl+c` or `Ctrl+d`

### Authors and Contributors
Fred Lin (@gasolin).

Thanks Neil Fraser, Q.Neutron from Blockly https://developers.google.com/blockly/
Thanks Dale Low (gumbypp) for contribute the python server to pipe BlocklyDuino source to arduino board.
Thanks Arduino and Seeeduino guys for Arduino and Grove blocks.

The project is also inspired by [arduiblock](https://github.com/taweili/ardublock) and [modkit](http://www.modk.it/)
